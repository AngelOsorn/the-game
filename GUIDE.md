# Setup
## Prerequisites
To get started with this kit, you must have the following completed:
- Download [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), the managing platform for Unity.
- Sign up for [a Unity Account](https://id.unity.com/en/conversations/cfede43a-4864-4242-8951-89a4a4e0d855003f?view=register) and obtain the free license, then sign in in Hub.
- Download **Unity Version 2022.3.4f1** in Unity Hub, the editor you will be using.
- Download [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) if you haven’t, you will write your code here.
- Finally, you can download the ZIP file for the project, and open it in Unity.
## Navigation
In the Unity Editor, there are 7 important parts of your screen:
1. The [Toolbar](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Toolbar.html) is the top bar of the editor. It has the play/stop button in the middle, which will compile and run your game, and then it has a pause button, which will freeze the frame of your game when running.
2. The [Game View](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html) shows what your game looks like from a player’s perspective in the Main Camera, which is an object in your hierarchy.
3. The [Scene View](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html) shows what your game looks like from a developer’s perspective. Here, you can place, move, rotate, and resize game objects.
4. The [Hierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) is the window that lists all your game objects. Here you can organize your objects and create parent-child relationships between them.
5. The [Project](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) window contains all the folders for your project’s assets, scenes, and scripts, in which you can drag and drop things into the scene view or the hierarchy to place them into your game.
6. The [Console](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html) is where all text-based output caused by your scripts will show up, whether it be printed messages or errors in your code. You can use this as a basic point of reference for debugging your scripts. Note: If your game isn’t running like it should be when you press play in the toolbar, it may be because you have an error here in the console, and you’ll have to assess it!
7. The [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) is where you can change the properties and the components of either a selected game object or a project asset. This is also where you will drag the scripts you code onto selected game objects to bring them to life.


As one last important note about the inspector: when you’re writing scripts for your project, they _will not run_ if they are not added as a component to an object in the hierarchy/scene view. 

To begin learning how to write scripts with the rest of the guide, we will add the `Example.cs` script in your assets to the camera. Start by clicking on the `Main Camera` object, scroll all the way down in the inspector tab, click `Add Component`, type and select `Example`. Now the Main Camera has `Example.cs` as an active component.

## Scripting
C# (pronounced "c sharp") is the programming language that Unity uses, and will be at the core of making things "work" in your game.
