# 'Nature Hunt' Unity GameDev Starter Kit
## Guide/Doc
The project will include various nature assets (trees, plants, animals, rocks, etc.), a default terrain configuration, and multiple built-in scripts to procedurally generate terrain and randomly place assets across the terrain.
Participants can rely on the guide and terrain generation documentation, both contained within this repository, for guidance on getting started with Unity, and becoming familiar with the tools we have provided.

As a general overview, the guide contains two sections and three subsections:

1. **Lessons**
   
   a. **Editor Setup**: Setting up the editor and learning how to navigate it.
   
   b. **C# Basics**: Grasping C# syntax and the fundamentals to Procedural & Object-Oriented programming.
   
   c. **UnityEngine Features**: Learning how to script with the engine's built-in methods & namespaces.
   
3. **Development**
   
   a. **Adding Assets**: Adding prefabs from the Assets window and modifying their properties.
   
   b. **Built-In Mechanics**: Utilizing and customizing the built-in pathfinding and terrain scripts.
   
   c. **Implementation Tips**: Getting started with creating and scripting concepts.
   

## Themes
The starter kit generally revolve around having nature-like terrain and animal NPCs that the player can design interactions with. The game should basically function as a 'task hunt', where the player has to look for environmental issues to solve firsthand in a timely manner. In general however, the theme will be satisfied by making use of the nature-like assets given to the participants and following some theme of conservation.

Note: The starter kit was initially geared towards acting as a basis for a scavenger hunt game, hence the name 'Nature Hunt.' However, as we've designed the starter kit and added more features, the starter kit has *way* beyond the potential to be transformed into a vast variety of games, so let your creativity run free and design a game that **you** would want to play!

## Assets
All .fbx files necessary for student usage (static models + rigged & animated models) are completed present in the Assets folder, all fitting the themes as stated above.
