# 'Nature Hunt' Unity GameDev Starter Kit
## Guide/Doc
The project will include only imported assets (static & animated .fbx files, UI .pngs, etc.), a lighting environment setup, and a capsule for player.
Participants can rely on a doc for the learning process as well as inspiration to make progress in development. The completed guide should take about 20-30 minutes to read and learn from for those who are completely new to both C# and Unity.

The in-progress guide is currently being worked on in the following google doc:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GzMUqiUlMbqCi8Pr90WyHHaRibz9al70u0bJiJcUAe8/edit?usp=sharing

As we near the completion of the doc, we will revise it into a structure with two sections and three subsections each as folows:

1. **Lessons**
   
   a. **Editor Setup**: Setting up the editor and learning how to navigate it.
   
   b. **C# Basics**: Grasping C# syntax and the fundamentals to Procedural & Object-Oriented programming.
   
   c. **UnityEngine Features**: Learning how to script with the engine's built-in methods & namespaces.
   
3. **Development**
   
   a. **Adding Assets**: Adding prefabs from the Assets window and modifying their properties.
   
   b. **Built-In Mechanics**: Utilizing and customizing the built-in pathfinding and terrain scripts.
   
   c. **Implementation Tips**: Getting started with creating and scripting concepts.
   

## Themes
The starter kit generally revolve around having nature-like terrain and animal NPCs that the player can design interactions with. The game should basically function as a 'task hunt', where the player has to look for environmental issues to solve firsthand in a timely manner. In general however, the theme will be satisfied by making use of the nature-like assets given to the participants and following some theme of conservation.

## Assets
All .fbx files necessary for student usage (static models + rigged&animated models) are completed present in the Assets folder, all fitting the themes as stated above. We plan on adding a few more as time and space allows.
