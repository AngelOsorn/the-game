# 'Nature Hunt' Unity GameDev Starter Kit
## Doc Plan
The project will include only imported assets (static & animated .fbx files, UI .pngs, etc.), a lighting environment setup, and a capsule for player.
Participants can rely on a doc for the learning process as well as inspiration to make progress in development.

The doc has first a lesson guide will consist of three sections: 

1. **Navigating the Workspace**: learning to use the workspace, move in the viewport, placing assets, adding components, camerawork, etc.
2. **Programming in C#**: this section will have an optional subsection that familarizes the reader with OOP to a heavily-summarized degree (enough to work between Unity GameObjects), and the rest of the section focuses on C# syntax.
3. **Scripting in Unity**: this section will focus on the key parts of the UnityEngine's behaviours in scripts, including understanding built-in methods like Start(), Update(), and then applying this knowledge to enable Rigidbody/Character/Camera movement at a basic level.

Next, the doc will have a development guide, which consists of mainly two sections:

1. **Asset Implementations**: this section will be highly recommended to follow so that participants can follow the theme closely and make the best use of the assets, but it isn't entirely necessary. This will include implementation of player tools, physics, simple NPCs animals, etc.
2. **Mechanic Tips**: it's suggested to work through one or two of the tips in this section for inspiration or getting unstuck. this section will include tips for mechanics that range from easy, medium, and hard in terms of difficulty and possible time-consumption. none of them will act as entire guides, but rather suggestions and hints of what to develop next so that participants can still implement creative and unique ideas that are also interesting on a technical level.

## Thematic Plan
The starter kit's assets generally revolve around having nature-like terrain and animal NPCs that the player can interact with. The game should basically function as a 'task hunt', where the player has to look for environmental issues to solve firsthand in a timely manner.

## Assets Plan
Currently no plan for developing a player model, will likely maintain a player POV in 1st person.

The player should have and utilize tools, some which will be animated, in which these tools are used to complete tasks and fix the environment.
Tool assets set to be completed include a Tranquilizer Gun, Water Gun/Hose, Bag of Seeds.

Static objects to fill the player's environments will include small objects (rock model, leaf 2D texture), large objects (trees, plants).

Animated models to be used for NPCs to inhabit the environment will include birds, fish, bears, squirrels.

In general, these assets should all be used to follow subthemes of conflicts that the player is to resolve, such as wildfires, deforestation, invasiveness, etc.
All models are also being modeled in Blender with a Low Poly artstyle, and will be stylized and rendered in Unity (URP) with an outline and toon shader.
